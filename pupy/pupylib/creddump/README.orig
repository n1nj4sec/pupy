#Information
This repo is for my modifications to the original 'creddump' program available
at: 

https://code.google.com/p/creddump/

I did not write the original program. 

I have combined many patches and fixes I have seen from different forums and
user suggestions, as well as modified the usage to make it a little more clear.

I followed patches and fixes from the following links:

* https://code.google.com/p/creddump/issues/detail?id=4
* https://code.google.com/p/volatility/issues/detail?id=92

Enjoy!

###Usage
Mount a Windows 7/Vista partition:
```
# mkdir /mnt/win
# ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /mnt/win
```

Run cachedump.py on the SYSTEM and SECURITY hives to extract cached domain creds:
```
# ./cachedump.py
usage: ./cachedump.py <system hive> <security hive> <Vista/7>

Example (Windows Vista/7):
./cachedump.py /path/to/System32/config/SYSTEM /path/to/System32/config/SECURITY true

Example (Windows XP):
./cachedump.py /path/to/System32/SYSTEM /path/to/System32/config/SECURITY false

# ./cachedump.py /mnt/win/Windows/System32/config/SYSTEM /mnt/win/Windows/System32/config/SECURITY true |tee hashes
nharpsis:6b29dfa157face3f3d8db489aec5cc12:acme:acme.local
god:25bd785b8ff1b7fa3a9b9e069a5e7de7:acme:acme.local
```

If you want to crack the hashes and have a good wordlist, John can be used. The hashes are in the 'mscash2' format:
```
# john --format=mscash2 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hashes
Loaded 2 password hashes with 2 different salts (M$ Cache Hash 2 (DCC2) PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-1 [128/128 SSE2 intrinsics 8x])
g0d              (god)
Welcome1!        (nharpsis)
```

We now have the passwords for two domain users. Note: these passwords are really simple and I knew they were in the wordlist I used. Normally if you want to actually bruteforce the passwords, I wouldn't recommend John. Pull the hashes and use a GPU powered cracking box with oclHashcat.


####Below is the original README file


OVERVIEW

creddump is a python tool to extract various credentials and secrets from
Windows registry hives. It currently extracts:
* LM and NT hashes (SYSKEY protected)
* Cached domain passwords
* LSA secrets

It essentially performs all the functions that bkhive/samdump2,
cachedump, and lsadump2 do, but in a platform-independent way.

It is also the first tool that does all of these things in an offline
way (actually, Cain & Abel does, but is not open source and is only
available on Windows).

REQUIREMENTS

alldump has only been tested on python 2.5. It should work on 2.4 as
well, but will likely need modification before it will work on 2.3 or
below.

python-crypto is required for its MD5/DES/RC4 support. To obtain it,
see: http://www.amk.ca/python/code/crypto

For lsadump: system and SECURITY hives
For cachedump: system and SECURITY hives
For pwdump: system and SAM hives

USAGE

Dump cached domain hashes:
  usage: ./cachedump.py <system hive> <security hive>

Dump LSA secrets:
  usage: ./lsadump.py <system hive> <security hive>

Dump local password hashes:
  usage: ./pwdump.py <system hive> <SAM hive>

FEATURES

* Platform independent operation. The only inputs are the hive files
  from the system--we don't rely on any Windows functionality at all.
* Open-source and (hopefully!) readble implementations of Windows
  obfuscation algorithms used to protect LSA secrets, cached domain
  passwords, and 
* A reasonably forgiving registry file parser in pure Python. Look
  through framework/types.py and framework/win32/rawreg.py to see how it
  works.
* The first complete open-source implementation of advapi32's
  SystemFunction005. The version in the Wine source code does not
  appear to allow for keys longer than 7 bytes, while the Windows
  version (and this version) does. See decrypt_secret() in
  framework/win32/lsasecrets.py
